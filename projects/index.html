    <h1>Welcome to the Projects Page!</h1>
    <p>This is a sample sub-page located at /projects/index.html.</p>
    <p>You can access this page at whatever.com/projects/.</p>
    <p>If you create another directory within the projects folder with its own index.html file, it will act as another sub-page.</p>
    <p>For example, /projects/projects1/index.html would be accessible at whatever.com/projects/project1/.</p>
    <p>Feel free to customize this page as needed for your project!</p>
