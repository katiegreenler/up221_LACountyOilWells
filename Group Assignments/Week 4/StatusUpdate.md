**Everyone** will complete individual data tasks as relevant to the assignment, contribute where they can, and try to plan around when folks can work. Madalyn & Myranda will likely work earlier in the week while others work over the weekend. Team meetings will be recurring weekly, and likely on Thursday’s.
## Status update: 
- The team works well together and communicates their progress and availability clearly. We have agreed to text for group meeting coordinations and other general communication, and use online platforms to share documents 
- The code and narrative of the project seems to be going in the right direction, and we have identified ways forward for the project after the midterm.
- Generally things are good when the code works, and a bit frustrating when the code doesn’t. When this happens we reference each other or the TAs as needed.
## Data update: 
We have not made significant changes to our datasets from what's discussed in our proposal, but we are making progress in examining the datasets in question. We are just starting this week to look at our primary dataset, [LA County Oil Wells](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/29f5d6391d0749a7ac59aacd40bb0846/explore?location=33.800844%2C-118.295000%2C9.16) from LA City GeoHub. Luis is the lead in using the review assignment as a method of cleaning the data and creating initial visualizations to get a sense of the data. Madalyn is taking the first look at cleaning [CalEnviroScreen](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/ed5953d89038431dbf4f22ab9abfe40d/) data to be paired with the oil wells and census data.
Our supplementary datasets are from the American Community Survey, specifically the 5-year estimates from 2022. We each took on data exploration for one the following themes in the previous assignment 
[Race & Ethnicity](https://www.socialexplorer.com/tables/ACS2022_5yr/R13563599), 
[income](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST5Y2022.S1901?t=Earnings%20(Individuals):Income%20(Households,%20Families,%20Individuals):Income%20and%20Earnings:Income%20and%20Poverty&g=050XX00US06037$1400000&y=2022&d=ACS%205-Year%20Estimates%20Subject%20Tables), [education](https://data.census.gov/table?t=Educational%20Attainment&g=050XX00US06037$1400000), [disability](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST5Y2022.S2701?q=health&g=050XX00US06037,06037$1400000&tid=ACSST1Y2022.S2701), and [home values](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSDP5Y2022.DP04?q=value&t=HousingValueandPurchasePrice&g=050XX00US06037$1400000&y=2022). Some of us have updated these census notebooks with new visualization strategies and attempted adding in the oil well data. There were some challenges with the previous assignment, particularly how to move income from multiple columns into usable data, which we set up as priorities for the review assignment.
## Concerns: 
We had two main concerns discussed within our meeting. First, there is a concern about coordinating within the busy schedules of our group, as well as when to set internal deadlines as people’s working styles differ. Thus issues around our internal coordination are our main concern though expected as we begin to work together. We agreed to communicate proactively over text and cowork when possible. The second concern regarded hitting a wall on assignments when there’s a small mistake or sometimes just an error. This can also be a major concern as the assignment deadline approaches.
